# Google Calendar Python Quickstart

I followed the steps described in the [Google Calendar Python Quickstart](
https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python), and I added more code to test some of the functions available with the GooCal API. The end result is the creation of a simple Python command-line application that
makes requests to the Google Calendar API.

## Install

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```shell
python quickstart.py
```
